## Coursework (Group)
One of the well establish supermarket chain is planning to setup their own IT systems and
infrastructure to support their business and to expand the operations efficiently. The supermarket
chain consists of followings, island wide sales outlets, reginal level 10 storage and logistic centres
covering the Island, head office which coordinate and provide all central support.
The supermarkets will provide in store shopping for traditional users and provide the online shop for
the new generation of users who are busy. The items perched from the online store will be delivered
to respective customer address or will be ready to pick up at a convenient outlet selected by the
customer (pickup on your way like drive through outlets).
NSBM Module Handbook 2019/20 Page 4 of 12
The supermarket chain maintain adequate stocks in each outlets and reginal store will send items
to outlets to top up the quantities whenever required. The chain also utilized state of art
transportation system where they will pick up fruits, vegetables, fresh meat and fish directly form
farms and will be processed (clean /categorized) send to outlets in a routine manner. The entire
supply chain is monitored and manage by a team 24/7 at head office. IOT and GPS systems are
used to monitor the entire transport fleet, store, outlets sales to identify the item supply and demand
on the stores.
The head office also has a command and control station to implement security and rated as C3i
grade the staff monitor all the shops, stores, transport lorries with a centralized CCTV with a help of
an analytical engine. The system allows command centre staff to directly communicate to any outlet
/store security focal point through VOIP and AOIP technology.
Tasks
# Part A
As the head of IT operation, you are supposed to provide a detail proposal regarding the IT
infrastructure, and you must convince the management to select a proper infrastructure deployment.
Currently you have an option of going with traditional server deployment, virtualized deployment or
cloud base (in private, public, community, or hybrid) and also in housed (on site) or offsite (ISP)
based deployment. Your report must explore all the possible technologies indicating all positive and
negative with the respective deployment models. The report must indicate one clear path giving
precise details which will be easy to decide on the solution without any ambiguity. The proposal
must address current operation future enhancements path for the organization. The proposal must
give all technical details.
Note: Your proposal must be different from the sample given on part B. (part B is one of a solution
with virtualized platform)
# Part B
Implement the core infrastructure servicers as given in the diagram using any virtual platform you
prefer with respective security settings. You must indicate all the key steps with screen shots with
correct justification for the steps. The group must be able to explain any implementation related
steps, technologies which used for the solution. The group must maintain a meeting logbook and it
needs to be presented during the group presentation.
The respective VM can be collected from the IT unit at SOC and will be available to download from
NSBM LMS system too.
